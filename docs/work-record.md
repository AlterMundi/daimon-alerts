# Implementation work record

2026-10-13: Human requested end-to-end implementation and quality qualification.
Requirement: https://github.com/compaii/shared-resources/blob/main/docs/requirements/daimon-alerts.md
Receiving owner: https://github.com/AlterMundi/telecodex/issues/82
Producer owner: https://github.com/nicoechaniz/hermes-memory-kit/issues/113

Observed authenticated AlterMundi repository creation succeeded. Existing HMK
provider_status.py provides safe problem classification and a durable outbox.
Concurrent portable_producer.py and memory_worker.py work is preserved. Existing
Telecodex has concurrent documentation/example changes; production listener is
independently owned and must remain running.

Implementation sequence: contract/fixtures publication, durable core qualification,
safe producer observer, operations qualification, receiving adapter coordination,
real complete-loop receipts, resource and portable skill adoption.

No runtime, Telegram receipt or receiving adoption is claimed at this stage.

Contract bundle qualification: five real process/HTTP tests pass, with every
HTTP success/error validated against the published JSON Schema. Includes two
independent service processes competing for one SQLite delivery (32 claims,
exactly one authorization), SIGKILL/restart retaining uncertainty, actor-scoped
acknowledgment replay, immutable final receipt, revisions/resolution ordering,
permission denial, body limits, pagination, admission cap, online backup integrity
and source/observer stale status. `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings`
passes. Runtime is local candidate software, not production delivery.
